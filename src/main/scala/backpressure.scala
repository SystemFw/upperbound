/**
  * Adds the ability to apply backpressure to the [[Limiter]].
  *
  * The `ack` parameter can be used to signal to the
  * [[Limiter]] that backpressure should be applied depending on the
  * result of `job`. Note that this will only change the
  * processing rate: it won't do any error handling for you.
  *
  * Every time a job signals backpressure is needed, the [[Limiter]]
  * will adjust its current rate by applying `backOff` to it. This
  * means the rate will be adjusted by calling `backOff`
  * repeatedly whenever multiple consecutive jobs signal for
  * backpressure, and reset to its original value when a job
  * signals backpressure is no longer needed.
  *
  * Note that since jobs submitted to the [[Limiter]] are processed
  * asynchronously, rate changes might not propagate instantly when
  * the rate is smaller than the job completion time. However, the
  * rate will eventually converge to its most up-to-date value.
  *
  * Also see [[syntax.backpressure]]
